## HomeKit support for Daikin One+ thermostats using [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io)

`homebridge-daikin-oneplus` uses the Daikin One+ API to allow native HomeKit support via Homebridge for any thermostats on your account.
> This plugin has been reported to work with Amana Home Wifi thermostats. No guarantees, but if it works with yours, drop a note in [this discussion](https://github.com/jeffschubert/homebridge-daikin-oneplus/discussions/52). 
## Accessories and their features (dependent upon your system/equipment capabilities):
  * Thermostat
    * Display current temperature
    * Display and set target temperature
    * Switch mode between cool, heat, and auto
    * Set both cooling and heating threshold in auto mode
    * Temporarily override a schedule
      * Schedule will be paused for a period of time based on how the thermostat is configured. The thermostat can be configured to pause for 1, 4, or 8 hours, or until the next event in the schedule.
    * Air Quality sensors
      * Display indoor and outdoor levels
    * Relative humidity sensors
      * Display indoor and outdoor levels
      * Set target indoor relative humidity
  * Schedule switch
    * Display and set thermostat's schedule state
  * Away switch
    * Display and set thermostat's away state
    * Optionally, the schedule can be enabled automatically when the Away switch is toggled off. By default this plugin and the thermostat itself do not enable the schedule after returning from Away.
  * Emergency Heat switch
    * Display and set thermostat's emergency/auxiliary heat state
  * One Clean fan
    * Trigger the thermostat to run the fan for a 3 hour One Clean cycle
  * Circulate Air fan
    * Allows the Circulate Air feature to be toggled between 'off' and 'always on'
    * Fan speed can be adjusted:
      * 0% : Off
      * 33% : Low
      * 66% : Medium
      * 100% : High
  * Version 2+ improves performance in several ways:
    * Reduce bandwidth by checking the Daikin API every 3 minutes or on demand when interacting with HomeKit (instead of the previous every 10s)
    * After updates, wait up to 15 seconds before checking API to avoid HomeKit showing stale data.
  * Version 3 
    * Minimum node version increased to 14
    * Plugin is now verified!


## Known Issue
  * Per [issue #20](https://github.com/jeffschubert/homebridge-daikin-oneplus/issues/20), it may now be necessary to request an integration token via the Daikin One Home app before this plugin can successfully communicate with the Daikin API.
    * To get an integration token:
      * Open the Daikin One Home app
      * Go to **account settings** on the Location/root/top screen of the app.
      * Select **home integration**
      * Select **get integration token**
      * Agree to terms
      * Enter your account password
      * Select **send request**
    * Once you receive the token, nothing further should be required.
    * You may need to uninstall/reinstall the plugin, or at least restart Homebridge to get a successful connection.
